                <p>Maps are an incredibly effective medium to communicate a story. Every phenomenon on this planet (and beyond) is tied together by the spatial dimension (so much so that statisticians can measure the so-called "spatial autocorrelation" of their subjects of study!) It is little wonder that data scientists have come to embrace the field of cartography into it's amalgam field of Data Visualization. In this document, I lay out how to create a map. As a geographer, I hope to communicate the best standards of the field to the interested burgeoning data scientist reading this page now.</p>

                <p>When you picture a map in your head, you have a certain image of what you would expect to see. We would consider the following to be essential for a map:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A title describing what the map is about, which should include the date the map is accurate for.</li>
                    <li>A scale to show what distances on the map represent in real life.</li>
                    <li>The name of the author, and potentially contact details.</li>
                    <li>A legend that describes what the symbols represent.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are considered the essential elements of the map. Other things can be included as well:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A cutaway map to contextualize the region.</li>
                    <li>Textual description of what the map is describing.</li>
                    <li>Spatial metadata, such as projection, datum, and coordinate system.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ultimately, what elements you decide to place on your map is up to you. But keep in mind that if your map is barebones, it will be difficult for your audience to utilize the map. They may not be able to follow up with you, or even understand the point your map is making! Creating your elements early is also a great way to ensure you are sticking to your point and keeping a consistent design.</p>
